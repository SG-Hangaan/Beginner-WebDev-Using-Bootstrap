				<h1><a href="#">The Evolution of Programming Languages</a></h1>
				<p>The evolution of programming languages mirrors the progression of computing itself, from 
				low-level machine code to high-level languages designed for human readability and productivity. 
				Early languages like FORTRAN and COBOL paved the way for structured languages like C and Java, 
				which are still widely used today. Recent years have seen the rise of dynamic languages such as 
				Python and JavaScript, known for their versatility and extensive libraries. As technologies like AI, 
				blockchain, and IoT reshape computing paradigms, new languages and frameworks continue to emerge, 
				catering to diverse application domains and developer preferences.</p>
